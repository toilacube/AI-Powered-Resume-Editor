# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the current single-resume application into a multi-project system where users can create, manage, and switch between multiple resume projects. Each project will maintain its own resume data, chat history, and analysis results, providing users with the ability to tailor different resumes for different job applications or career paths.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create new resume projects, so that I can maintain separate resumes for different job applications or career paths.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks a "New Project" button THEN the system SHALL display a project creation form
2. WHEN the user enters a project name and confirms creation THEN the system SHALL create a new project with a unique identifier
3. WHEN a new project is created THEN the system SHALL automatically switch to that project
4. WHEN a new project is created THEN the system SHALL initialize empty resume data for that project
5. IF the user attempts to create a project with an empty name THEN the system SHALL display a validation error

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view a list of all my projects in a sidebar, so that I can easily see and access my different resume projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a collapsible left sidebar with all projects
2. WHEN the sidebar is open THEN the system SHALL show each project's name and latest chat message preview
3. WHEN the user clicks the sidebar toggle button THEN the system SHALL open or close the sidebar
4. WHEN the sidebar is closed THEN the system SHALL show only project icons or a minimal view
5. WHEN no projects exist THEN the system SHALL display a message encouraging project creation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to switch between different projects, so that I can work on multiple resumes without losing my progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks on a project in the sidebar THEN the system SHALL switch to that project
2. WHEN switching projects THEN the system SHALL save the current project's state to local storage
3. WHEN switching projects THEN the system SHALL load the selected project's resume data and chat history
4. WHEN switching projects THEN the system SHALL update the UI to reflect the active project
5. WHEN a project is selected THEN the system SHALL highlight it in the sidebar

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to rename my projects, so that I can keep them organized with meaningful names.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user right-clicks on a project in the sidebar THEN the system SHALL show a context menu with rename option
2. WHEN the user selects rename THEN the system SHALL display an inline edit field with the current name
3. WHEN the user confirms the new name THEN the system SHALL update the project name in storage and UI
4. WHEN the user cancels renaming THEN the system SHALL revert to the original name
5. IF the user attempts to rename to an empty string THEN the system SHALL display a validation error

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to delete projects I no longer need, so that I can keep my workspace clean and organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user right-clicks on a project in the sidebar THEN the system SHALL show a context menu with delete option
2. WHEN the user selects delete THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation modal
3. WHEN the user confirms deletion THEN the system SHALL remove the project and all its data from local storage
4. WHEN a project is deleted AND it was the active project THEN the system SHALL switch to another project or show empty state
5. WHEN the last project is deleted THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to create a new project

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want each project to maintain its own resume data independently, so that changes in one project don't affect others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user modifies resume data in a project THEN the system SHALL store it under a project-specific key in local storage
2. WHEN switching between projects THEN the system SHALL load the correct resume data for each project
3. WHEN a project is created THEN the system SHALL initialize it with default resume structure
4. WHEN resume data is saved THEN the system SHALL use the format "resume\_<projectId>" as the storage key
5. WHEN a project is deleted THEN the system SHALL remove its associated resume data from local storage

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want each project to maintain its own chat history, so that job analysis conversations are kept separate per project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user has chat conversations in a project THEN the system SHALL store them under a project-specific key
2. WHEN switching projects THEN the system SHALL load the correct chat history for that project
3. WHEN displaying the sidebar preview THEN the system SHALL show the latest chat message from each project's history
4. WHEN a project has no chat history THEN the system SHALL display a default message in the sidebar preview
5. WHEN a project is deleted THEN the system SHALL remove its associated chat history from local storage

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to remember my last active project, so that I can continue where I left off when I return.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user switches to a project THEN the system SHALL save that project ID as the active project
2. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL automatically open the last active project
3. WHEN no active project is stored THEN the system SHALL open the first available project
4. WHEN no projects exist on startup THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to create their first project
5. WHEN the active project no longer exists THEN the system SHALL fall back to the first available project
