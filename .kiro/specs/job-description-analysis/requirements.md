# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to analyze job descriptions against their resume to identify skill matches and gaps. The system will provide an action button that opens a text area for job description input, then use Google Gemini AI to analyze the job requirements against the user's resume data, returning a structured comparison of matched and missing skills/requirements.
